    "\n",
    "> Great work Angus. Looks like you had some good insights from the readings. I have some more comments throughout the notebook. You did well getting all the Python code as well. You have some great ideas for the projects. One thing I want to guide you with is ease of data access. What are the 2 easiest projects to get data for would you say?|\n",
    "\n",
    "##Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_3\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Keypoints taken out of the book\n",
    "* Alot of times companies still do not know what data science entails or they are not 100% sure they know what they want them to do.\n",
    "* There are alor of different types of \"Data Scientists\"  whiles all work on the same sort of things, certian ones are better suited to different areas, eg Data Business people, while probably not a full data scientists they are still considered part of the field, while others are much stronger on the programming or big data.\n",
    "* The majority of data sciencitists are profficient across all parts of data science usually while being very strong in one core part of the field.\n",
    "* This would mean that to be truely sucessful you would need a combination of different T shapped data scientists \n",
    "* What data scientists are working on now and current career paths will be totally different in the next few years. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "> Really good summary Angus\n",
    "> Glad you identified the T shape - this is something I am trying to emphasize as well (the importance of being well rounded)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Summary\n",
    "* The Majority of this book seems to have a common theme of you will never know everything, you need to be able to learn just in time. Be able to sit down say I need to learn this and then self teach.\n",
    "* Majority of Data Science is not done one on one. It is usually a group of people solving a problem, espicailly if each person has a different strength. If you enter a new DS job be prepared to work hard as you cant bounce ideas of people when your not there.\n",
    "* Focus on simple things. Simple things become hard, hard things become intractable.\n",
    "* Open Source Data Science Masters\n",
    "* 3 good websites, Quora, Zipfian Acadmey, Coursera.\n",
    "* Last interview I didnt feel had much.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, teamwork is a crucial part of data science. And there will be members of your team with different specialities. Learning when and how to work together is an important skill to have.\n",
    "> It's all about simple things - do them right and then build on a solid foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. Boat IoT tracker, using a Raspberri Pi install on boats and gather the data uploaded to AWS. Using this, owners can track real time what is going on with their boat. On top of this when the boat is running it can give up to date info regarding the boat. \n",
    "  \n",
    "> I like this idea. Do you know how the sensors will capture data? This will be pretty important. But if you can get the data I think this would be a really interesting project\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. ecommerce.   ecommendations and personalization.  eg 'We see your ordering this on your iphone 5, how about you get this case to protect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There's a lot of really good ideas here - do you have access to one of these data sources though?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loyalty. Automatically generating a response etc, We see youve been with us for 2 years. As thanks have the next box on us. Thanks for being such a loyal customer\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loyalty. On the back end. the majority of people unsubscrube after 4ish months. So as a hook automatically offer them 10% off their 5th or 6 box. or an extra accessory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Product: How many do we need to order to keep things stocked, when should we take the winter clothes off the store and start selling summer? Is there something we are missing in our product line\n",
    "\n",
    "* Supply Chain Management: Working out average delivery time from different factories, minimising times that a box is shipping late as its missing its big must have piece. Is there a prediction for abnormal weather in the next month and can we generate a product that will be useful. eg summer but massive cold from predicted so brand new scarf as the fashion item.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customer service: Ability to go through the customer service records. pick out keywords and which allows analysis of what happens and why they are unhappy. Poor quality box, order didn't arrive on time. etc etc. Correlate this to unsubs and gives the ability to see what is a bad enough experience that people will unsub.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customer insights- Especially with the sharks customer database, this is key to workout who you want to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age, who are the people ordering your boxes, young professionsal that live inner west? Girls who live south west, east. If 90% of your customer base lives in the west and 10 in the east, you'll obviously tailor your box to them, same for age are they 20 or 45? all these things mean you can tailor the box and what you sell on the site to your market. Or find out why your missing a market.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I really like this one. Possibly tying in census/offline data is a great way to add insights to what you already have.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Marketing, which facebook ad is working if your are running 2 or more? Of each add which one generates traffic and which one generates a sale? How many emails are you able to send before you become a nuisance and they unsub. customer surveys: verbatum feedback analysis. what are the main pluses or negatives that your customer base has an issue with. How can we fix that?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web Analytics: Where to people come from? Once on the site where do they go? Where to most people bounce from? Why? How do we fix this? Once they have added to cart and go why? What page were they on? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Payment: Which payment is the most used? How can we make this more seamless. Moreback end: Which do we have the most issues with on failed payments. instead of continually charging we can send an automated email. Hi we have tried to charge this account please put money in or give us another cc to charge etc etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Netcomm data, to start with, base data on customer service verbatiums maybe also phone also scrape whirlpool.net.au. Track key words to gain insites into main issues. use this to give advanced warning if a firmware is issued and customer service complaints jump 5% outside of normal and whirlpool blows up giving the engineering and marketing team advanced warning. \n",
    "  \n",
    "> This is an interesting idea. Have a look at the alchemy or watson API to flesh this idea out a bit more.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Machine forcasting for work. Taking last 4-5 years of results and forecasts and tack how close they were. Using this hopefully we can track how close we were and using these numbers and adjusting for issues/expected wins etc we can work out a good way to forcast\n",
    "  \n",
    "> Forecasting/predicting is a really important Data Science skill. Not only does it involve statistics but it also relies on communication and business acumen to get the benefits of the forecasting. If you have access to a reliable data source this could be a really good project\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. Bit Left of field after talking to someone else probably too hard due to no way of getting the data. Facial reconnition tracking which can determin how happy people are. Once we can do that track people within a Westfield or other mall. Useing a heat map you could see where people are most happy. Allows you to check how useful putting up xmas lights are, where are people most happy so charge more for that shop. See how well renovations have changed peoples attitiude. etc. WOuld be nice, No idea how to get the data/ enough time to build a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "> hmmmm... I like this one and there is a similar project out there, check out [SelfieCity](http://selfiecity.net/) and see if it's something you'd like to do. You could put your own spin on it (focussing on hapiness). I would say it's doable if you're interested in it. Maybe even compare hapiness of different networks (twitter vs Instagram)?\n",
